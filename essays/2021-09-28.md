The introduction of the WOD is to make a receipt table that caculated the the total, subtotal, also the extented price. At first I had a good idea of what to do in the beginning but when it came to making the table that is when it got a little bit weird because the formatting of the table was broken down as it was a deformed table. It was hard to find the point of error but it was difficult. I refered back to the screencast and there was not problem with my code but in all it was not as bad as other WODs because I am starting to get comfortable with using varibles. The beginning of the WOD with the start of creating was not as bad as the ending where creating the table was a bit frustrating. It took me only a couple times to figure out what was wrong but overall it was not that bad.
