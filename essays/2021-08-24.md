The first time that I have heard of M.I.S was through my older sister as she talked about all the good and bad things throughout her college experience. At the time I was still a junior in high school and never thought about what I really wanted to do. I never thought about what I wanted to become when I was younger until my freshman year of college where I was commited to M.I.S because I enjoyed playing video games and spending majority of my time on a computer. I also enjoyed figuring out how to install new hardware into my computer which also made me realize technology is interesting when it comes to coding. Knowing how things function efficiently and properly was a thing that got me intrigued into finding a career path that involved technology heavily.
