I think that my programming skills have greatly improved by understanding and knowing the different ways something could be generated just like our web pages. I could understand what is going on and what is need but I mainly need to work on is understanding where my mistakes are but also the my formatting my code is messed up which I need to work on. The other thing I would need to work on is getting more knowdledge of what code can be placed at which location. The labs give me a general understanding of what needs to be done but when it comes to making a more complex code to fit the requirement I think that it becomes harder. I don't feel like I am ready to work on the next stage of complexity in programming because the my Assignment 1 had a lot of problems when it comes to routing and properly adding verification to my code. I think that the class can be improved by taking the basics and help students build more complex codes with the help of labs and run them through it. I think that most people that took this class had little to none knowledge about coding which makes it more difficult because we need to make websites when we dont know what is going sometimes. I think that a couple things that work for my learning in class is attending and listening to class but also ask questions on why the code needs to be there or generated like that.
